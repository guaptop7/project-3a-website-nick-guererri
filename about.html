        <p>For project part 3 I aim to create a virtual production using the 3D scene I created in Unity. I created a city/town in part 2 of the project which can now be used as a backdrop for chroma keying content onto the display. Using animations and other forms of movement in Unity, I hope to create a city-like atmosphere where actors can interact with these objects in the scene. Although the story or motivation is not yet set, I hope to develop something meaningful.</p>
