        <h1>Plan</h1>
        <p>For my project I plan to create a driveable/walkable sandbox world similar to Grand Theft Auto. In this world the character will be controlled in third person while navigating the environment. I plan to implement some interactables like money and an enter/exit script so players can interact with cars. Assets will be pulled from the asset store along with character and vehicle controllers.</p>

        <p> <b>Final Statement: I called this project Sandbox Explorer because it’s pretty much up to the player what they
            want to do. Originally, I wanted to do something similar to GTA or any other open world/sandbox
            shooting and racing game, but the arcade style lets the user do whatever they want. Because of the
            spawner, users are able to build (similar to Fortnite stairs) and spawn cars into the scene. Money is
            collected in the console (at first it would output to the HUD but no longer works with the controllers),
            and Cars are set to max speed and drifting velocities so that it simulates “toy-like” driving</b></p>
