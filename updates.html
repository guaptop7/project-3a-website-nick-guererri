    <h2>11/20/23</h2>
    <p>Began project with idea of virtual production but eventually became set on a sandbox world similar to GTA and other walkable/driveable games. </p>
    <h2>11/27/23</h2>
    <p>Focusing on physics for cars in the scene. Need to setup a city or environment for the world.</p>
    <h2>11/29/23</h2>
    <p> Added a Realistic Car Controller + working on finding an enter exit system for interacting with cars. Video example below.</p>

    <p>Goals:
        Enter/Exit, Build Environment, Create and implement interactables.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>12/4/23</h2> 
    <p>trying to pick between the realistic-car-controller or this simple car controller (below). The RCC model is very detailed which is making it hard to implement an enter/exit script without knowing parameters. Looking into adding interactables like money which the player can collect. Might try outputting to a canvas, the money values and/or a speed gauge for the car.</p>

    <h2>12/6/23</h2> 
    <p>Switched the Realistic Car Controller asset to a simpler controller and model so that I could use an enter exit method. Took me a couple of days to find an enter/exit script that functioned with my assets, trying to build a city similar to my previous project where there is half city; half nature, now I'm done with the controller/movement functions.<li><a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/prometeo-car-controller-209444" target="_blank">Free Car Controller</a></li></p>

    *Enter/Exit script is not written by me, I meant the configuring*

    <h2>12/15/23</h2>
    <p>added left and right click spawner for the vehicles and stairs, also added the interactable coins/money that the player and car can collect locally through the log.</p>
    <h2>12/17/23</h2>
    <p>final touches to the main world, added a start screen.</p>
